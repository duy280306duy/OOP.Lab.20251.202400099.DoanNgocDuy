Yes, Java allows you to do this, as long as the constructors have different parameter lists 
In Java, you can define multiple constructors in the same class this is called constructor overloading.
However, each constructor must differ in the number or type of its parameters.
Java allows you to create multiple constructors only if they have different parameter lists.
You cannot have two constructors with exactly the same parameter type (for example, both taking a String).
